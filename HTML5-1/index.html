    <p>In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The internet was without form and void, and text was
        upon the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard and Tim said, Let
        there be links; and there were links. And Tim saw that the links were good; and Tim separated the links from the
        text. Time called the links Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff. And the whole thing together was the
        first Web Page.</p>
